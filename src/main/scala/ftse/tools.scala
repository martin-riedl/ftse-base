package ftse

/** Provides classes that implement helpful functions for logging, workflow definitions and binding of external tools 
 *
 *  == Overview == 
 *  - Logging capabilities (e.g. for logging intermediate transitions systems via DOT-graphs or Petri-Nets)
 *  - Stepwise elimination algorithm (as a feasability study, i.e. it is very slow)
 *  - CASPA binding 
 *  - Pipes and batch processing capabilities, when dealing with external tools, e.g. CASPA, DOT, etc.
